# metronome.html

A metronome as a single html file with css and javascript embedded. 

I actually like it better than any metronome app I've used. One of my use cases is that I work on speeding up a passage so let's say I start at 80 BPM and then I want to gradually up the tempo by increments of 4, 6, 8, or 10. You can do it with one keystroke with my little metronome.

I tested it on Chrome and Firefox on Linux Mint and mobile Android. Seems to work fine.

The code isn't that hard, so you could use this as the basis of your own metronome customized to your preferences.

This article was the key to getting it to work well, especially on mobile: https://meowni.ca/posts/metronomes/.
